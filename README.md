# Bloomy

Fast bloom filter library written in Rust. My attempt at creating a production-ready
crate with as nice of an API, documentation, tests, and CI as possible.

- [ ] Proptest
- [ ] Plotters empirical vs. analytical
- [ ] No std version?
- [ ] Par iter with rayon?
- [ ] Common traits, make it thread safe?
- [ ] Cargo bench with criterion
- [ ] Other common traits that could be useful
- [ ] All CI items
